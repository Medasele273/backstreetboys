        <p>Backstreet Boys (often abbreviated as BSB)[3] is an American vocal group, formed in Orlando, Florida in 1993. The group consists of AJ McLean, Howie Dorough, Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson, and Brian Littrell.

            The group rose to fame with their debut international album, Backstreet Boys (1996). In the following year, they released their second international album Backstreet's Back (1997) along with their self-titled U.S. debut album, which continued the group's success worldwide. They rose to superstardom with their third studio album Millennium (1999) and its follow-up album, Black & Blue (2000). After a two-year hiatus, they regrouped and released a comeback album Never Gone (2005). After the conclusion of the Never Gone Tour in 2006, Richardson left the group to pursue other interests.[4] The group then released two albums as a quartet: Unbreakable (2007) and This Is Us (2009).</p>

        <p>In 2012, the group announced that Richardson had rejoined them permanently.[5] In the following year, they celebrated their 20th anniversary and released their first independent album, In a World Like This (2013). The Backstreet Boys are one of the few boy bands to have continued success long after their peak. Their 2019 album DNA debuted at number one, more than two decades after the group formed. In doing so they have achieved numerous milestones, including the third longest gap between number one albums on the Billboard 200 chart, at over 19 years, surpassed by Paul McCartney's 36-year gap and Santana's 28-year gap, and being the first boy band to top the U.S. charts in three different decades.</p>
